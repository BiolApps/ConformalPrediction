## Introduction to Conformal Prediction (CP)
Conformal prediction is a easy an efficient method to generate statistical rigorous uncertainty. This method allows the generation of prediction sets that are guaranteed to contain the ground truth high probability only under the i.i.d assumsion for any underlying model.
