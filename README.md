# Conformal Prediction in Genomics

## Introduction to Conformal Prediction (CP)
Conformal prediction is a easy an efficient method to generate statistical rigorous uncertainty. This method allows the generation of prediction sets that are guaranteed to contain the ground truth high probability only under the i.i.d assumsion for any underlying model.

This repository applies conformal prediction in three different applications in genomics.
* Binary classification problem for response or nonresponse of patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and Crohn's disease to infliximab (infliximab) using
Trunsductive Conformal Prediction (TCP)
* Multi-class classification problem for the classification of patients according to their gene expression profile, in the different transcriptional subtypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), using Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP)
* Regression problem for patient response to the anticancer drug (Afatinib) according to cancer cell gene expressions using Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP)
